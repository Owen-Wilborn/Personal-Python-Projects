anagrams.py â€“ Finds all direct anagrams (anagrams of same length such as rat and tar) of input word by two methods. Method one finds all permutations of the input word and compares each permutation against a given dictionary. Second method sorts every word in the dictionary by alphabetical order of their characters based on ASCII (such rat becomes art) and then compares the sorted words with the sorted input word for identical matches. Code prints the direct anagrams of the input word to the screen for both methods. Must included own text file named words.txt with all words desired to include in the dictionary to run program (uploaded text file contains 10,000 popular english words).
